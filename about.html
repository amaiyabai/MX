            <hr>
          <p>Before she became unemployed to focus on web designing full on, Mai Xiong worked full-time as a barista in Cupertino, CA.</p>
          <p>She first dabbled in coding at 10 years old to make layouts for <underline>asianavenue</underline> & <underline>xanga</underline>, but
            has not touched coding since and only recently picked it back up.
            </p>
          <p>When she isn't writing about herself in the third-person, she enjoys taking photos, latte pouring and looking up
            recipes to cook for her girlfriend. </p>

            <p>
            Mai and her girlfriend both enjoy staring at their dog, Casey.
